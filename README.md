# yith-wapo-csv
The plugin is designed to export and import YITH WooCommerce Product Add-ons (WAPO) into CSV files. It handles the tricky part of flattening complex settings and options data (which can be serialized arrays or nested JSON) into columns for CSV, and then reassembling them back when importing.
